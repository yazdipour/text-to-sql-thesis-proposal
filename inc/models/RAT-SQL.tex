\begin{itemize}
    \item A major challenge in translating natural language queries into SQL queries is generalizing them to unknown database schemas.
    \item As part of the generalisation, it is necessary to encode database relations in an accessible way and model alignment between relevant database columns in the query.
    \item Within a text2SQL encoder, the proposed framework leverages the relation-aware self-attention mechanism to encode address schemas, represent features, and link schemas.
    \item Check out the flow chart below for an overview of RAT-SQL's encoder-decoder structure.
\end{itemize}
