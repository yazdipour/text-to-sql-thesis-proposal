% ? The state-of-the-art should show the reader a broad overview of techniques available and how they are related to one another in a hierarchical way like a mindmap. Describe the methods briefly and explain the weaknesses and strengths of the methods and how you want to use them to solve your problem.

\section{Motivation and State of the Art}

Representative datasets for Text-to-SQL include the WikiSQL\cite{zhong_seq2sql_2017} dataset and
the SPIDER\cite{yu_spider_2019} dataset, which contains more complex SQL queries.
We will also take a shallow look at older datasets and why they are not in use anymore in Text-to-SQL studies.
The former case consists of Single Table - Multiple Question and the latter case Multiple Table - Multiple Question. The top models available for Text-To-SQL will be studied, and the implementation of a couple of currently best methods will be reviewed and discussed in this study.

In this thesis, we will review the Text-to-SQL Challenges and datasets and structure of existing datasets and difference between them. Datasets to be covered are: ATIS, GeoQuery, IMDb, Advising, WikiSQL, Spider.
