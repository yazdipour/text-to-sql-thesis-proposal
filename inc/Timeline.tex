\section{Timeline}

The timeline for the project will be broken down into four phases: literature review, establishing the theoretical framework and research implementation, using some datasets on a state-of-the-art model, and finally, documenting our study.

    \textbf{Phase One}   & \multicolumn{1}{p{3cm}|}{\centering August\newline September\newline October, 2022} & \textbf{Literature Review}: The first phase will be a review of any literature considerations. It includes examining how other researchers have approached the topic and a discussion of challenges around this research problem. Many considerations need to be addressed in this phase, such as the goal, the data, and how researchers find solutions for such a task. \\

    \textbf{Phase Two}   & November, 2022                                                                      & \textbf{Theoretical Framework and Research implementation}: The second phase is where A theoretical framework of a model will be established and implemented. In order to do this, a variety of different approaches will be explored, which are possible to implement with our hardware and legal license limitations.                                                   \\
